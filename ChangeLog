	* args.c : fixed handling of comments in the profile file.
	* args.c : profile file can also be specified by the environment variable INDENT_PROFILE
	* io.c output.c : extracted output code from io.c and put it in output.c
	
2002-02-26 David Ingamells   <d.ingamells@hccnet.nl>
	* comments.c : reduced problems with -st and repeated calls. Still a bug when 2
	comments on one line.
	
2002-01-22 David Ingamells   <d.ingamells@hccnet.nl>
	* indent.h : hopefully reduced problems when building without the gettext library.
	
2002-01-22 Charles Lecklider <charles@invis.co.uk>
	* config.h.watcom makefile.watcom.in : Added files for use with Watcom compiler.

2002-01-17 David Ingamells   <d.ingamells@hccnet.nl>
	* io.c : Files will now always get a newline at the end of file if the input was missing
	one. This now matches the default behaviour of vi.
	* args.c : Parameterised argument lists for gnu, kr and orig setting sets.

2002-01-17 Carlo Wood <carlo@alinoe.com>
	* texinfo2man.c : Fixed handling of @@ within a @email{}. Now only one @ is output.
	
2002-01-08 David Ingamells  <d.ingamells@hccnet.nl>
	* configure.ac : Fixed problems of autoconf items used by gettext being defined instead
	of just "required". This should fix problems with a missing stpcpy during build.
	* automake.am : fixed order that directories are listed. This ensure that the intl directory
	is built before the indent executable.
	Added the I18N files that have been delivered by the translation team. There are
	now 15 languages supported in addition the coded English messages.
	* po/* : Added 15 .po files from the I18N team.
	* src/indent.h : Fixed include of the gettext include file. (removed "intl/")
	* src/indent.c : Fixed problem in multi-file mode where input file is truncated if
	the backup file exists and is write protected.

2001-12-04 John Bridges <indent@peekpoke.com>
	* indent.dsp, wildcard.c : improvements for vc++.
	
2001-12-04 Vladislav Naumov <vnaum@echo.ru>
	* miscel/Makefile.mingw32 : Some fixes for the the mingw32 compiler's makefile.
	* miscel/config.h.vc++ : prevent UTIME for mingw32.
	
2001-11-27 David Ingamells <d.ingamells@hccnet.nl>
	* makefile.am,*/makefile.am : Major changes to the Makefile.am files to reflect the new 
	deep structure and to come closer to the current auto-tool styles.

2001-11-02 David Ingamells <d.ingamells@hccnet.nl>

	* general : Changing over to 'deep' release structure with src, doc, etc. directories. This
	is requiring a major revamp of the "auto" tool input files.

	* lexi.c : Allowed a string to be multi-line (i.e. newlines from code file is part of string).

	* all_source_files : ANSI-ize all functions and clean-up layout. Break up some too-big functions.
