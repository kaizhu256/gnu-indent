	* configure.in:
	Unreleased the package, so decreased the version number again.

	* Makefile.am:
	Some maintainer targets needed to depend on configure.in for the VERSION.

	             --case-brace-indentationN and --paren-indentationN.

	if you had indentation problems, chances are it WILL be fixed now.
