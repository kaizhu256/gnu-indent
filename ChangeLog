	From: malekith@ikar.mps.com.pl
	Date: Thu, 26 Aug 1999 15:06:10 +0200 (CEST)
	To: indent@runaway.xs4all.nl
	Subject: Additional C++ support in indent (diff)

	What have I done?

	1. I removed -c++ arg check from indent.c, since it didn't work anyway (try)
	and put into args.c. I think you put it in indent.c because you wanted
	different set of options for C++, an I right? But for now ...

	2. In io.c I changed compute_label_target() func. Now if in_decl and
	c_plus_plus it returns one indent level back for labels, e.g.
	[...deleted...  this is still broken --Carlo ]

	3. I've added second set of keywords and hash func. This is in lexi.c.
	Lack of ``try'' keyword is intended. It caused errors (nested stmts or
	something). I couldn't handle this.

	4. Added recognizing GNU C++ >? and <? operators (and not documented >?= and
	<?=). It won't harm anyone since in normal C++ there can't be such
	combination of characters.

	5. I don't know why, but if colon is in_decl it is treated strange way.
	If c_plus_plus is set I changed this to handle ``public:'' and so on.

	Note from Carlo Wood:

	That is because in declarations you can have:

	  int foo:4;

	etc. In order to distinguish this from 'public:' etc, I am now
	testing for the 'i' (of the 'int') before treating the colon special.

1999-08-25  Carlo Wood, Runaway  <carlo@jolan>

	* io.c:
	Bug report by Darius Powell: When the parser sees a left brace it clears
	the procedure name out but not the classname ...

	* NEWS, args.c, backup.c, backup.h, configure.in, indent.c, indent.h, indent.texinfo, io.c, io.h, sys.h:
	New option --preserve-mtime: Preserve modification times on output files.
	Preserve modification times on backup files.  Thanks to Ian P. Springer
	for the idea.

1999-08-05  Carlo Wood, Runaway  <carlo@jolan>

	* regression/standard/enum.c, regression/enum.c, NEWS, lexi.c:

	Added prototypes.
	De-ANSI-fied some inconsistent places.
	Removed memcpy.c.
	Should compile with a K&R compiler again now.

	Thanks to Kaveh R. Ghazi for report:

	        The following are some patches I needed to get indent-2.1.1
	working on SunOS4 using cc.  A couple of notes:

	1.  You may wish to use the AM_C_PROTOTYPES macro from automake-1.4.
	It'll define PROTOTYPES in config.h if they are available.  I had the
	test in sys.h check for it assuming you would use it when I defined
	the PARAMS macro to handle prototypes.

	2.  The way memcpy is handled seems like overkill.  You do
	AC_CHECK_FUNCS and define it to bcopy if not there.  You also call
	AC_REPLACE_FUNCS.  You also hard code including memcpy.c in the
	sources.  It seems to me that doing just the first check and defining
	it in sys.h is enough.  Get rid of the REPLACE check and the file
	memcpy.c file.

	3.  If you insist on prototyping free() for some reason, at least
	check whether the system already defines it for you.  I ran into
	conflicts with SunOS defining it to "extern int free()" and your
	source did "extern void free()" which bombed.  You can find various
	ways of doing this, egcs-1.1.2 has a NEED_DECLARATIONS check which
	works well.

	4.  If you insist on using ANSI style function definitions, you should
	do it everywhere and use automake's ansi2knr option for older systems.
	Until then, I un-ANSI-fied the inconsistent places where it appeared.

	* regression/standard/const.c, regression/TEST, regression/const.c, indent.c, indent.h, parse.c:
	Detect the `const' qualifier more reliable.
	Thanks to bug report by Lars Hecking.

1999-07-16  Carlo Wood, Runaway  <carlo@jolan>

	* configure.in, sys.h:
	Don't combine memmove and memcpy detection: SunOS 4.1.4 doesn't have
	memmove, according to Nico Kadel-Garcia.

	* configure.in: Bumped version number to 2.1.2

1999-07-15  Carlo Wood, Runaway  <carlo@jolan>

	* indent.texinfo:
	Added comment to Bugs about comments getting too far to the right.

	* indent.texinfo, texinfo2man.c:
	Added `@dircategory' as per suggestion of Albert Chin-A-Young.

1999-07-09  Carlo Wood, Runaway  <carlo@jolan>

	* globs.c: Need to include <errno.h>, some OS define errno as macro.

	* io.c, sys.h:
	Renamed SYS_READ to INDENT_SYS_READ because of a name collision on HPUX.

	* configure.in: Bumped version number to 2.1.1

1999-07-04  Carlo Wood, Runaway  <carlo@jolan>

	Added break points at non-spaces (after scope resolution operator,
	the global operator, member selection operators, and before subscripting,
	function calls and value constructions (all left brackets thus)).
	Also assigned a rough priority to them to keep the members of higher
	prioritized binary operators together.

	due to removal of -fc1 from regression/TEST.
