This directory contains the 1.10.0 release of GNU indent.

The last version prior to 1.10 was 1.9.1 that was released five years ago.
I volunteered to start maintaining GNU indent because I wrote a patch for
it a year ago that fixed quite some bugs and added a few new features
(commandline options). I decided that the only way to let everyone benefit
from my fixes is by making it an official release.

If you find other bugs or have ideas for new features, then feel free to
mail me at <carlo@gnu.org>, however I can't promise that I will add new
features because I have only limited time available for this project.
What really needs to be done is a total rewrite of indent, including support
of C++.

For general building and installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.

See the file NEWS for what has changed since previous releases.

GNU indent is fully documented in indent.texinfo.  See the section entitled
`Problems and Bugs' for information on submitting bug reports.

The file `texinfo.tex' has been removed from the indent package because it
is much too big to be stored on all GNU packages imho.  If you need it to
generate DVI files for printing the manual, then please download the latest
version yourself from http://texinfo.org/.  Instead of killing a few trees
by using paper, you should learn to use regular expressions and/or get used
to the info program I think.  You can also generate HTML documentation from
the file `texinfo.tex' with the program `texi2html'.

GNU indent is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
